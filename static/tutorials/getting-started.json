Red Hat Streams for Apache Kafka uses the SASL/OAUTHBEARER authentication mechanism over TLS to provide secure connections between your applications and Kafka instances. SASL/PLAIN authentication is also available for tools and libraries that do not support SASL/OAUTHBEARER, but SASL/OAUTHBEARER is recommended whenever possible. When you generate credentials for a Kafka instance, Streams for Apache Kafka creates a service account that contains the generated user name and password associated with the instance.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<div class=\"title\">Prerequisites</div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You have created a Kafka instance in the Streams for Apache Kafka web console and the instance is in <strong>Ready</strong> state.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<div class=\"title\">Verification</div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Did you save the bootstrap server endpoint to a secure location?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Did you save the client credentials to a secure location?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"
